# PureSperm 40/80

****

**Ready-diluted to save gradient preparation time.**

All the advantages of a [PureSperm][0][100][1] gradient, plus ready-diluted to save preparation time. PureSperm 40 and PureSperm 80are formulated to minimize sudden pH and osmolarity changes during the transition of sperm from the semen sample to the fertilization medium. This helps to avoid premature hyperactivation and improves fertilization potential.
