# PureSperm 40/80

**Ready-diluted to save gradient preparation time.**

All the advantages of a [PureSperm][0][100][1] gradient, plus ready-diluted to save preparation time. PureSperm 40 and PureSperm 80are formulated to minimize sudden pH and osmolarity changes during the transition of sperm from the semen sample to the fertilization medium. This helps to avoid premature hyperactivation and improves fertilization potential.

# PureSperm 100

**For the preparation of density gradients**

**_PureSperm 100_**is a sterile colloidal silica suspension in an isotonic salt solution. It is optimized for the preparation of [density gradients][2] used to separate and purify human sperm from semen for use in Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART). This system effectively separates normal sperm from lymphocytes, epithelial cells, abnormal, immature and senescent sperm, cell debris, bacteria and seminal fluid.
