## PureSperm 100

**For the preparation of density gradients**

**_PureSperm 100_**is a sterile colloidal silica suspension in an isotonic salt solution. It is optimized for the preparation of [density gradients][0] used to separate and purify human sperm from semen for use in Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART). This system effectively separates normal sperm from lymphocytes, epithelial cells, abnormal, immature and senescent sperm, cell debris, bacteria and seminal fluid.

## PureSperm 40/80

**Ready-diluted to save gradient preparation time.**

All the advantages of a [**_PureSperm 100_**][1] gradient, plus ready-diluted to save preparation time. **_PureSperm 40_**and**_PureSperm 80_**are formulated to minimize sudden pH and osmolarity changes during the transition of sperm from the semen sample to the fertilization medium. This helps to avoid premature hyperactivation and improves fertilization potential.

## PureSperm Buffer

**Maximize sperm survival during density gradient centrifugation.**

**_PureSperm Buffer_**is designed specifically for two functions; first as a balanced salt solution for diluting [**_PureSperm 100_**][1]to make up two layers of different densities for the gradient, and secondly, to reduce viscosity in the semen sample. The formula of**_PureSperm Buffer_**is optimized for maximum sperm survival  and greatest yield during[density gradient centrifugation][2].

**A three-in-one product.**

**_PureSperm Wash_**is a three-in-one product. It is optimised for washing the sperm pellet recovered after[density gradient][2] preparation, for use in [swim-up procedures][3], for extending the sperm prior to Intra Uterine Insemination(IUI), and as a maintenance medium.
