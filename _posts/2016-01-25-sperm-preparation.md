_**PureSperm 100**_is a sterile colloidal silica suspension in an isotonic salt solution. It is optimized for the preparation of [density gradients][0] used to separate and purify human sperm from semen for use in Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART). This system effectively separates normal sperm from lymphocytes, epithelial cells, abnormal, immature and senescent sperm, cell debris, bacteria and seminal fluid.

**Ready-diluted to save gradient preparation time.**

All the advantages of a _**[PureSperm 100][1]**_ gradient, plus ready-diluted to save preparation time. _**PureSperm 40**_and_**PureSperm 80**_are formulated to minimize sudden pH and osmolarity changes during the transition of sperm from the semen sample to the fertilization medium. This helps to avoid premature hyperactivation and improves fertilization potential. 

## PureSperm Buffer

**Maximize sperm survival during density gradient centrifugation.**

_**PureSperm Buffer**_is designed specifically for two functions; first as a balanced salt solution for diluting _**[PureSperm 100][1]**_to make up two layers of different densities for the gradient, and secondly, to reduce viscosity in the semen sample. The formula of_**PureSperm Buffer**_is optimized for maximum sperm survival and greatest yield during[density gradient centrifugation][2].

## PureSperm Wash

**A three-in-one product.**

_**PureSperm Wash**_is a three-in-one product. It is optimised for washing the sperm pellet recovered after[density gradient][2] preparation, for use in [swim-up procedures][3], for extending the sperm prior to Intra Uterine Insemination(IUI), and as a maintenance medium.
